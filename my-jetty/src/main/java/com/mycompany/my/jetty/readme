The DefaultServlet implements the ResourceFactory interface and extends the HttpServlet abstract class.
It is usually mapped to / and provides handling for static content, 
OPTION and TRACE methods for the context. The MOVE method is allowed if PUT and DELETE are allowed. 
See DefaultServlet javadoc.
